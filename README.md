### Challenge Overview:
This is my submission of the frontend challenge!

### Challenges:
- I had very little experience with NextAuth, so I took some time to learn and apply.
- I had difficulty handling the roles section at the middleware, and understanding the middleware as a whole.
  
### Things I would do differently
- I would've use [Clerk](https://clerk.com/), that gives me everything that I did way faster and free, but I didn't wanned to cheat, so I used Next-Auth.
- I would've handle the errors in other way than sending a query param to the frontend, just didn't found out a better solution in the mean time.
- **Definitely** improve the frontend style, the thing is pretty ugly.
- Improve the tests to cover 100% of the project.

### Tech
- Created the project using [T3](https://create.t3.gg/)
- Used [Railway](https://railway.app/) to host the database
- Used [Emailjs](https://www.emailjs.com/) to send the emails
- Used [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to test
- Used [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as my ORM
- And the other tech was the one required by the test. Next, React, TypeScript, etc.
